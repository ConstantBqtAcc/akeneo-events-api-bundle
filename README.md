# Akeneo PIM Events API

The Events API is a smooth and easy way to build integrations that respond to activities in Akeneo PIM. 
All you need is PIM Events API Bundle and an endpoint where to send Akeneo PIM events.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

* Akeneo PIM >= 3.0 (CE & EE)

### Installation

Install via composer:

```bash
php composer.phar require trilix/akeneo-events-api-bundle:^0.5.0
```

To enable the bundle add to the *app/AppKernel.php* file in the registerProjectBundles() method:

```php
$bundles = [
    // ...
    new \Trilix\EventsApiBundle\TrilixEventsApiBundle(),
]
```

Add the following line at the end of *app/config/parameters.yml*:

```yaml
events_api_request_url: 'endpoint_url'
```

where `endpoint_url` is an endpoint url of a consumer which accepts events from Akeneo PIM.

Add the following lines at the end of *app/config/config.yml*:

```yaml
trilix_events_api:
    transport:
        factory: "pim_events_api.transport_factory.http"
        options:
            request_url: "%events_api_request_url%"
```

Run the following command to create a job to deliver events to consumer:

```bash
bin/console akeneo:batch:create-job 'Deliver outer event to consumer' deliver_outer_event_to_consumer internal deliver_outer_event_to_consumer
```

## Functionality

### How it works

* Some event(s) happens in Akeneo PIM. This triggers a mechanism to send those event(s) to a consumer
* Consumer receives a JSON payload which specifies event (the same data format like Akeneo PIM API uses)
* Akeneo PIM Events API Bundle uses separate job to deliver events to consumer
* The sending of events happens in real-time

      "de_DE": "Cameras",
      "en_US": "Cameras new name",
      "fr_FR": "Cam√©ras"
    },
    "parent": "master"
  },
  "event_time": 1565021907
}
```

#### Event Type Structure

| Field        | Type | Description                                                                                 |
| ------------ |:-------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| *event_type* | String  | Type of event which happened (see [event types](#Event types delivered over Events API)) |
| *payload*    | Object  | Contains information which represents the event                                          |
| *event_time* | Integer | Timestamp in seconds when the event was created                                          |

### Attention :heavy_exclamation_mark:

If Akeneo family contains variants, then during family update (or it's variants as well),
Akeneo will re-save related products. It will trigger sending *product_updated* events.
